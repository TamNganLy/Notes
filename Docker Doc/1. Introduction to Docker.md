## Kernel
- An Operationg System is made up of 2 main parts: the kernal and files/programs.
- The kernal usually interacts w. and controls the hardware.

## What does a Docker Container run
- The OS is made up of kernal + applications.
- Any applications from the OS you want to use, need to be included in the container (e.g. Bash, curl, etc.)
- You also need to include Python, pip, and install dependencies your app needs.

## Docker image
- A snapshot of source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and everthing else (except the PS kernel) that a container needs to run.

### Create an image (python flask)
1. Create a Dockerfile
    ```
    FROM python:3.13
    EXPOSE 5000
    WORKDIR /app
    RUN pip install flask
    COPY . .
    CMD ["flask", "run", "--host", "0.0.0.0"]
    ```
2. Open the terminal
    ```
    docker build -t [image-name] .
    ```
3. Run the image
    ```
    docker run -p 5005:5000 [image-name] .
    ```
    or run in background
    ```
    docker run -dp 5005:5000 [image-name] .
    ```
    *5005 is the assigned port*
