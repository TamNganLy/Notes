## Kernel
- An Operationg System is made up of 2 main parts: the kernal and files/programs.
- The kernal usually interacts w. and controls the hardware.

## What does a Docker Container run
- The OS is made up of kernal + applications.
- Any applications from the OS you want to use, need to be included in the container (e.g. Bash, curl, etc.)
- You also need to include Python, pip, and install dependencies your app needs.

## Docker image
- A snapshot of source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and everthing else (except the PS kernel) that a container needs to run.
